Spring Boot microservice that **consumes Kafka events** (e.g., `ListingStatusChangedEvent`) and sends email
notifications.
It includes **Dead Letter Topic (DLT) handling** for failed messages and automatic retries.

- **Kafka** ‚Äì event-driven messaging, including DLT
- **Mailpit** ‚Äì local email testing
- **JUnit + Mockito** ‚Äì unit & integration testing

## ‚ö° Features

- Consume Kafka events published by [Listing Service](https://github.com/baris-top-portfolio/listing-service)

the [Listing Service](https://github.com/baris-top-portfolio/listing-service) README

## üîÑ CI/CD

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration (and deployment):

- **Build Job:** Compiles the application and creates a JAR artifact
- **Tests Job:** Runs automated Maven tests with test profile
- **Docker Job:** Builds and pushes Docker images for release tags
- **Deploy Job:** (Dummy for local k3s) Simulates deployment to local Kubernetes cluster

For more details, check `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yaml`.

## üì• Installation & Local Setup

For installation, see the separate INSTALL.md. It includes:
